Search bar with items to select/filter like Amazon, [IMDb](https://www.imdb.com/) and so on. Some inspiration / examples can be seen [here](https://codepen.io/scottmbulloch/pen/gpdYdR) and [here](https://bootsnipp.com/snippets/9Avx).

## Fields for Artist profile update

After the basic fields of the registration form (first name / last name / email / password) the user can complete his/her artist profile with further information. The fields to edit on the profile are:

 - Bio (Artist Bio): Text Area for the artist to write the bio.
 - Username/Artist Name/Nickname: `string` for the artist create a username. FOR FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS: We can make this dB field `UNIQUE` so for the personal 'concert hall' of each user we can just attach the ID of the user on the page (e.g. www.aplaudo.com/concertroom/1234) or, in the case that the user update a username, we can append this username (to be more nice) on the address, like on GitHub (e.g. if my username is abelroland my concert room on Aplaudo would be www.aplaudo.com/concertroom/abelroland). The same goes to profile page and so on.
 - Instrument: Dropdown list of instruments for the artist to choose which instruments he/she plays.
 - Style: Dropdown list of styles for the artist to choose which styles he/she fits in.
 - Country: Dropdown list of countries for the artist to choose the country of origin.
 - Social MediaLinks: On the front-end, it will be like a to-do list, where the user can just push the button `ADD LINK`. When the user pushes this button it opens a table with two fields: "LINKS" and "VALUE". The user can choose which social he/she wants to add to the profile (YouTube / Spotify etc.) and then insert his/her personal profile on this social medias. After push submit the user will see the links that he/she added and can choose to add new links.
 An HTML file with the table is send to explain it in a more clear way. NOTE ON QUALITY: This is not something to focus too much if takes too much time, but it would be good that all the links that are added pass for validation, so YouTube links can just be added if YouTube is choosen and so on.  You can see the HTML example [here](https://github.com/abelRoland/aplaudoDOcs/blob/main/tableLink.html)
 - Creations: Place where the user can put some links for YouTube videos. On the user profile that will be a carousel with the videos that the user upload.
